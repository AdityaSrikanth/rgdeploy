Currently these interpretations exist largely in private or encumbered databases resulting in extensive repetition of effort.

The SRA represents the largest publicly available repository of SARS-CoV-2 sequencing data. This dataset was created by DNAstack using SARS-CoV-2 sequencing data sourced from the SRA. Where possible, raw sequence data were processed by DNAstack through a unified bioinformatics pipeline to produce genome assemblies and variant calls. The use of a standardized workflow to produce this harmonized dataset allows public data generated using different methodologies to be combined and compared for a more powerful global analysis of available SARS-CoV-2 data, allowing researchers rapid access to aggregated downstream results for accelerated insight generation. Methodology: Reads from the SRA were extracted in FASTQ format, then entered into a different pipeline depending on the sequencing technology used to create the reads: the [ARTIC protocol](https://artic.network/ncov-2019/ncov2019-bioinformatics-sop.html) for Oxford Nanopore-derived reads; the [SIGNAL pipeline](https://github.com/jaleezyy/covid-19-signal) for paired-end Illumina reads; and the [CoSA pipeline](https://github.com/PacificBiosciences/CoSA) (using [DeepVariant](https://github.com/google/deepvariant) for variant calling) for PacBio reads. Briefly, reads were primer-trimmed and aligned to the SARS-CoV-2 reference genome, following which contiguous regions were assembled and variant sites were called. [Pangolin](https://github.com/cov-lineages/pangolin) was then used to assign viral lineage based on the assembled genome.\n",

    "description": "The UCSC Genome Browser is an online graphical viewer for genomes, a genome browser, hosted by the University of California, Santa Cruz (UCSC). The interactive website offers access to genome sequence data from a variety of vertebrate and invertebrate species and major model organisms, integrated with a large collection of aligned annotations. This dataset is a copy of the MySQL tables in MyISAM binary and tab-sep format and all binary files in custom formats, sometimes referred as 'gbdb'-files. Data from the UCSC Genome Browser is free and open for use by anyone. However, every genome annotation track has been created by an academic research group, or, in a few cases, by commercial companies. Please acknowledge them by citing them. The information can be found by going to https://genome.ucsc.edu, selecting the respective genome assembly and clicking on the data track. At the end of the documentation, we provide a list of references and acknowledgements.",
